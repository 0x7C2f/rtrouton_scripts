Starting in 10.7.2, Apple set the iCloud sign-in to pop up on the first login. Since having this appear may not be desirable in all Mac environments, it makes sense to be able to turn this off for new user accounts.

Apple is using /Users/username/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SetupAssistant.plist to store  the settings that indicate whether or not the iCloud sign-in process has run. Building on work done by the folks behind DeployStudio, I've built a script that pre-sets those values for new and existing accounts on a particular Mac. In turn, that should stop the iCloud pop-up message from appearing on that Mac.
