This Casper Extension Attribute checks 10.11 and later Macs to see if System Integrity Protection is disabled. If System Integrity Protection is disabled, script returns "Disabled". If System Integrity Protection is enabled, script returns "Active".

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
