This Absolute Manage custom information item checks to see if a Mac is running 10.7 or higher. If the Mac in question is running 10.7 or higher, the EA reports on whether or not the Mac's boot volume is encrypted with Apple's FileVault 2 encryption and gives the encryption or decryption status. 

See "Absolute_Manage_Custom_Info_Item_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Custom Information Item should be configured.
