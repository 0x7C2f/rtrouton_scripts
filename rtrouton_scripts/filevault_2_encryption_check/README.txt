This script checks to see if a Mac is running 10.7 or not. If the Mac in question is running 10.7, the script reports on whether or not it is encrypted with Apple's FileVault 2 encryption and gives the encryption or decryption status.

I've also posted a Casper-specific version of the script, for use as an Extension Attribute.
