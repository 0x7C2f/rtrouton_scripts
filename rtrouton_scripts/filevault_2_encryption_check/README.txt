This script checks to see if a Mac is running 10.7 or not. If the Mac in question is running 10.7, the script reports on whether or not it is encrypted with Apple's FileVault 2 encryption and gives the encryption or decryption status.

I've also posted a Casper-specific version of the script, for use as an Extension Attribute.

There have been other folks who have built their own scripts based on mine, and were kind enough to share back the results. All of those folks are in the "scripts_by_third_parties" directory.
